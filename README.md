# Change URL Extension

This browser extension changes the URL of Reddit and X (Twitter) to bypass login requirements, allowing you to browse these platforms anonymously without having to create an account. It modifies URLs as follows:

- **Reddit**: `www.reddit.com` to `old.reddit.com`
- **X (Twitter)**: `x.com` to `xcancel.com`

> [!Note]
